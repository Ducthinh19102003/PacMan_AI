## Progress:
### 1. Modify the game to change difficulty
- [x] Include more ghosts (Up to 8 ghosts)
- [x] Directional Ghosts (Choose move that minimizes mahattan distance)
- [x] Random Ghosts
- [x] Random Ghosts with patterns (tendency to move horizontally and vertically)
- [x] Intelligent Ghosts (Choose move that minimizes __true__ distance with some stochasticity)
- [x] Incorporate different types of ghosts to the game (Right now only __all__ random ghosts or __all__ directional ghosts are possible)
- [x] Implement ghosts that can eat dots

### 2. Minimax Pacman & Ghosts
- [x] Implement baseline algorithms of Minimax, Expectimax with Alpha-Beta pruning
- [ ] Implement Minimax, Expectimax with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with hand-crafted feature sets for evaluation function

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- [x] Approximate Q-learning with hand-crafted feature sets
- [x] Baseline (Double) Deep Q-Learning 
- [ ] (Double) Deep Q-Learning with actor-critic
- [ ] (Double) Deep Q-Learning with dual networks
- [ ] (Double) Deep Q-Learning with prioritized replay
